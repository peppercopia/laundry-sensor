# laundry-sensor
Laundry Sensor is a NodeMCU-based project used to relay laundry events (ie. WasherStopped, DryerStopped) to a central MQTT server.  It does this by monitoring the vibration from your washer or dryer and deriving what on/off state it is in. Implemented with Arduino deployed on an ESP8266(NodeMCU chip) using an attached SW420 vibration sensor.
